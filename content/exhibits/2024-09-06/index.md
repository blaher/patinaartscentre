We are delighted to present "Wings and Whimsy," an art exhibition celebrating the annual butterfly release at Beech Creek Botanical Garden & Nature Preserve.

"Wings and Whimsy" brings together a diverse group of artists whose works explore the whimsical and profound aspects of these ethereal creatures. Through various mediums and styles, each piece reflects the grace, vibrancy, and fleeting nature of butterflies, inviting viewers to experience a world of imagination and wonder.
