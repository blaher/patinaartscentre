Maria M. McDonald is an oil painter who works and lives in Massillon, Ohio. In December of 2023 she received her BFA in Painting from Kent State University. She has been making art since she was a child but hadnâ€™t decided to pursue a career in it until taking a painting class at Kent which led her to switch her major to painting. She paints about her experiences and emotions and draws inspiration from mythology, religious texts, pop culture, music, and objects. Through her work she expresses her inner world and analyzes her view of society as a woman. She is beginning the process of creating another body of large-scale paintings exploring her inner self and the hidden aspects of love and how it is experienced.
