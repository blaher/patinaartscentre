Benjamin is a contemporary artist, originating from North East Ohio. Bringing his emotions in to his narrative pieces, as well as capturing the sights he has trekked in his landscapes.

Ben paints emotions, not necessarily subjects, but using his subjects and narratives as a tool to resonate those emotions. Objectively, if you look upon one of his paintings and it bubbles up feelings or memories, that's what he seeks to accomplish with his artwork. He's no stranger to evoking suppressed memories and his story is that of battling his way through the hell of trauma, loss, and emotional suppression.

He's a relatively new artist but clearly born with talent. Just starting painting since December 2023. His paintings are a testament of his skills and he hopes to keep honing those abilities further for everyone else to see in each new painting in the future.

Ben works primarily in watercolor and oil.
