Tom Delamater is an abstract artist based in Canton, Ohio

Tom's artistic journey is admittedly unusual for having occurred late in life. It's been one of discovery â€” not only of the techniques and methods involved, but of self. He has gravitated toward exploring layers, texture and depth, which only makes sense; as humans, we all have layers of our own, which often obscure the real person hiding underneath.

Over time he developed an interest in abstract expressionism, largely because of its emphasis on spontaneous, personal expression over traditional techniques or subject matter. He is particularly fascinated with how it evolved in defiance of cultural norms and shifted the attention of the art world to New York in the mid-20th Century. The range of expression and interpretation possible in the abstract genre inspires his art today.
